# 9809 format Raw Data

Please refer to the following link for a detailed explanation of the 9809 format: <br>http://titan.nusr.nagoya-u.ac.jp/Tabuchi/BL5S1/doku.php/tabuchi/9809format

In 9809 format, the X-ray energy corresponds to **spectrometer angle**, <br>and the absorption coefficient corresponds to **the values of incident and transmitted light** (i.e., before calculating the absorption coefficient).

In the case of raw data in the 9809 format, the information described as conventional raw data is entirely different. 

Therefore, before conducting the analysis, it is necessary to calculate the X-ray energy and absorption coefficient.

## Calculate Method

If the raw data is in the 9809 format, it will be in the following format(**.dat file**).
