# 9809 format Raw Data

Please refer to the following link for a detailed explanation of the 9809 format: <br>http://titan.nusr.nagoya-u.ac.jp/Tabuchi/BL5S1/doku.php/tabuchi/9809format

In 9809 format, the X-ray energy corresponds to **spectrometer angle**, <br>and the absorption coefficient corresponds to **the values of incident and transmitted light** (i.e., before calculating the absorption coefficient).

In the case of raw data in the 9809 format, the information described as conventional raw data is entirely different. 

Therefore, before conducting the analysis, it is necessary to calculate the X-ray energy and absorption coefficient.

## Calculate Method

### 1. If the raw data is in the 9809 format, it will be in the following format(**.dat file**).

![9809datfile](/World/figure/9809_1_datfile.png)

Please extract only the part related to the measurement data and copy & paste it into a new txt file. 

Don't forget to change the file extension from dat to txt.

![9809txtfile](/World/figure/9809_2_txtfile.png)


### 2. The following code extracts the values ​​required for each calculation from the second column (Energy), the fourth column, and the fifth column (Absorption coefficient).
```
import os
import numpy as np

# You need to create two folders : one for the raw data (Before_folder) and one for the extracted data (Middle_folder).
# "Before_folder" : Enter the path to the folder containing the raw data (data before extraction).
# "Middle_folder" : Enter the path to the folder containing the extracted data.

Before_folder = '/home/yourname/XAFS/txtfile_9809Before' #Users can modify as needed.
Middle_folder = '/home/yourname/XAFS/txtfile_9809Middle' #Users can modify as needed.

file_list = [f for f in os.listdir(Before_folder) if f.endswith('.txt')]

for file_name in file_list:
    input_file_path = os.path.join(Before_folder, file_name)
    output_file_path = os.path.join(Middle_folder, file_name)
    
    with open(input_file_path, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    
    data = []
    for line in lines[2:]:
        values = line.split()
        if len(values) >= 5:
            data.append([float(values[1]), float(values[3]), float(values[4])])
    
    data = np.array(data)
    
    np.savetxt(output_file_path, data, fmt='%.6f')
```

When you run this code, you will obtain the following txt file:

### 3. Calculate the X-ray energy and absorption coefficient based on the above extracted data.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the **spectrometer crystal** and **measurement method**, it may be necessary to adjust the numerical values and strings within the code.

```
import os
import numpy as np
import math

# You need to create one more folder for calculated data ("After_folder").
# "Middle_folder" : Enter the path to the folder containing the extracted data. (Use the same path as the previous Middle_folder)
# "After_folder"  : Enter the path to the folder containing the post-calculation data (i.e., the data before conventional normalization).

Middle_folder = '/home/yourname/XAFS/txtfile_9809Middle' #Users can modify as needed.
After_folder  = '/home/yourname/XAFS/txtfile_9809Calculated' #Users can modify as needed.

file_list = [f for f in os.listdir(Middle_folder) if f.endswith('.txt')]

for file_name in file_list:
    input_file_path = os.path.join(Middle_folder, file_name)
    output_file_path = os.path.join(After_folder, file_name)
    
    with open(input_file_path, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    
    data = []
    for line in lines:
        values = line.split()
        if len(values) >= 3:
            value1 = 12398.42436 * (1 / (2 * 3.13551 * math.sin(math.radians(float(values[0]))))) # Users can modify as needed.
            value2 = math.log(float(values[1]) / float(values[2]))                                # Users can modify as needed.
            data.append([value1, value2])
    
    data = np.array(data)
    
    np.savetxt(output_file_path, data, fmt='%.6f')
```

> [!NOTE]
> + **Spectrometer Crystal**: Please enter the actual measured values. Typically, Si(111) = 3.13551 (default), and Si(311) = 1.63747.
> + **Measurement Method**: For the conventional transmission method, use math.log(float(values[1]) / float(values[2])) (default). For the fluorescence method, use float(values[2]) / float(values[1]).
